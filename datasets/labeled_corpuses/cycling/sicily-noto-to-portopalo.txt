A SEASIDE JOURNEY ALONG THE SICILIAN COAST
Right along the coast of Sicily, this ride (that we enjoy on our Private Sicily Biking trip) is best taken in the morning accompanied by the splendid scent of salt water and fresh air. Starting from Noto, a beautiful town with 17th and 18thC architecture, pedal on quiet roads lined with vegetable and fruit plantations. You’ll pass some of the coast’s most beautiful traditional fishing villages, and through scenic Portopalo di Capo Passero and the lovely Isola delle Correnti (Isle of Currents). Don’t say no to a dip in the ocean after grabbing the freshest catch of the day for lunch!
