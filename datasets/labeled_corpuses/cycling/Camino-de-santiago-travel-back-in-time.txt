TRAVEL BACK IN TIME
All roads lead to the same destination when you’re on pilgrimage: in this case, do it by two wheels while you travel the hallowed Way of St. James. On our Camino de Santiago trip, step back in time to peruse the well-preserved prehistoric stone and thatched-roof huts of O’Cebreiro, as you make your way from the top of a ridge and cruise downhill through the verdant lushness of Galicia, ending at a working monastery.

Distance: 31.5 km
Recommended Rider Level: Enthusiast (3/5 Difficulty)
