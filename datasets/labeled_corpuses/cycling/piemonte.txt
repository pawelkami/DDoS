Piemonte – Alba to Costigliole d’Asti
HAZELNUT HEAVEN
Hazelnut groves abound in this region of Italy, which cleverly invented Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella (a.k.a. gianduia). From the town of Alba, ride by mountain peaks in the distance, then cruise in a winding descent towards Neive and Barbaresco, the vine-rich villages of the Barbaresco wine appellation. Perhaps that red wine will improve your legs as you pedal onwards on a quiet (but no less spectacular) route to Costigliole d’Asti.
