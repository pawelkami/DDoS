The running route measures 5 km. The surface of the route is 60% paving stone and 40% chippings. The loop extends between three bridges: Szczytniki Bridge (most Szczytnicki), Jagiellonian Bridge (most Jagielloñski) and Warsaw Bridge (most Warszawski). The whole of the route runs along the floodbank. The route is flat and surfaced, making it very well suited to beginners.
