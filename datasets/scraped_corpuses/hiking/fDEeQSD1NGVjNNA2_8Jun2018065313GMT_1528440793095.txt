About Me
I am an avid hiker and backpacker from British Columbia.  I have been hiking most of my life, and really got into backpacking when I was 14.  I started going hiking with my dad around that time (he's a pretty awesome hiking partner), and we've had some pretty fun adventures in the outdoors.  I like hiking because it gives me the opportunity to see some of the wonders of nature, and also puts me in an environment where it is socially acceptable to consider a snickers bar (or twelve) to be lunch.  It also gives me the nostalgic feeling of not caring whether or not I get muddy.

I would consider myself to be average with regards to pack weight.  I'm generally happy with a base weight of 15-20 pounds.  I'm still working on packing a little lighter, but I don't see myself cutting off my pack straps or shaving bristles off of my toothbrush.  I've already learned a lot about packing light (for example, you don't need to carry two weeks of fuel for a two day trip... yes I've done that), and feel like I'm semi-competent.

Anyways, I've decided to start a blog largely because I enjoy writing almost as much as I enjoy hiking.  I'm going to be doing a lot of hiking trips in the next few years, and I would like to document my travels so I can look back and remember all of the good times I've had in the woods.  In addition, since I will be documenting my successes and failures (expect more failures), I am hopeful that others may be able to learn from my experiences, and possibly avoid some of the mistakes I will inevitably make.  Personally, I have found other peoples' blogs to be very informative and helpful for that very reason.   I don't know if my blog will be of any help or interest to anyone, but I hope it is.
