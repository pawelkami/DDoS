cycling At the moderately famous Col de la Faucille is the main road back to Geneva. It’s not my favourite – traffic, including lots of trucks on weekdays – as it is a main short cut from Geneva to Dijon. Mathias climbs it fairly frequently, so I decided to show him a better, nearby, deserted-but-paved alternative via Col de Combe Blanche.See the map to find this road. Basically cycle the main road from Faucille away from Geneva and head to La Vattay. This is one of my favourite cross-country ski stations. At La Vattay, turn in on the only paved road, and just follow. This heads all the way down the Jura mountains – and don’t expect to see more than a car or two. It’s a fantastic alternative.
cycling This very quiet Jura loop climbs three cols and passes two others (Col de Bérentin; Col de Colliard). It is in the same massif – but to the north – of the tougher and better known Grand Colombier, and Col de la Biche.While not the steepest roads, this route is almost always going either up or down. At the top of the first climb, Col de Cuvéry, is Plateau de Retord – one of my favourite cross country ski locations. But the snow has finally melted.I consciously designed this loop counter-clockwise as it lets me descend Col de Bérentin (and its tunnel – I hate uphill tunnels). And it also lets me climb the very fun little road to Col de Belleroche. There was a sign near the bottom saying the road way closed in 3kms, I was worried there might still be snow on this north-facing forest route. But still decided to have a look.No snow, they just haven’t yet got around to cleaning the road of winter debris. Fortunately, at the speed I climb, it was easy enough to avoid any rocks or branches:After Col de Belleroche things get easier. On a sparsely populated plateau the route gently descends for 15 or so kilometres before re-entering the woods and climbing the easier side of Col de Richemond – there was still some road graffiti visible from the 2012 Tour de France.The descent from Richemond is not too technical, and thus fun even for me, winding through the woods.This is classic Jura mountains cycling: A hilly route where you will see more kilometre markers than cars.
cycling A scenic loop up and over the Massif de la Chambotte, in the French Jura mountains, on extremely quiet roads. Fantastic.My friend Chris and I debated here whether the Chambotte massif is in fact a Jura (geologically yes) or an Alp (geographically yes).Starting from bustling Rumilly it takes about two minutes to escape traffic and begin the climb up the east side of Col du Clergeon. It’s 15 kilometres to the summit, but that includes some downhill.Leaving the pastures, through the higher woods, are a few steep kilometres, before finally reaching the Col on a plateau near the summit of Mont Clergeon. The west side faces the redoubtable Grand Colombier and is shorter, thus steeper, with more hairpins – I descended very slowly. Details climbing the west side (plus an ascent of nearby Col du Sapenay) – are here.As shown on the map below, I descended to just above the main road, taking a quieter route traversing vineyards to the start of Col de la Chambotte.This is not the toughest climb (360 metres of ascent) but it’s beautiful: climbing on a narrow road with cliffs on the left and Lac du Bourget on the right.

cycling The well-known, but thoroughly over-rated, Col de la Faucille is nearby. But La Barillette is one of several far more interesting, higher, virtually car-free, well paved, steep climbs in this section of the Jura mountains. Also see Col de la Vattay, and La Baudichonne.Sections of the climb are one-way on the way up, with different one-way stretches for the descent. Today, there was only one possible way up. A combination of uphill stretches and going the wrong way on the descent stretches. See map below to take the correct turns and avoid doubling back. In summer — just follow the signs to La Dôle.As I got higher, it was chillier and plenty of snow. But except for one stretch near the summit, the road was dry and clear.
cycling Despite its great name, I had never cycled to La Vue des Alpes – in part because someone had once told me the road – while wide – could have some fast traffic. The Juras are full of deserted, fun, little forest roads.

Fantastic:Similar to the nearby excellent climb to Chasseral (its distinctive summit was frequently in view), the route consists of two climbs on forest roads – split by a long flatter stretch through an open bucolic plateau.The 2nd uphill stretch begins with a sign warning of hard work ahead:There are several super steep short stretches as the route contorts to avoid the main road. It then enters the Tete de Ran ski area. It’s a fabulous, typical little single lane Jura farm road:The high point of the route is beside the Tete de Ran – above 1300 metres – and then it’s a 2 kilometre slight descent to La Vue des Alpes (1283 metres).

running The running route between the Jagiellonian Bridges (mosty Jagielloñskie) and Swojczyce Bridge (most Swojczycki) is c. 6 km. The surface of the route, beyond bridge sections (c. 300 m), is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 90% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees, which line both sides of the boulevard. Each kilometre is marked, useful in measuring running speed.
running The running route measures 5 km. The surface of the route is 60% paving stone and 40% chippings. The loop extends between three bridges: Szczytniki Bridge (most Szczytnicki), Jagiellonian Bridge (most Jagielloñski) and Warsaw Bridge (most Warszawski). The whole of the route runs along the floodbank. The route is flat and surfaced, making it very well suited to beginners.
running The running route in East Park (park Wschodni) is a loop of a length of 3 km. The surface of the route is metalled, with slight ascents surfaced with paving stone occurring on bridges. The route is extremely picturesque, with long sections beside a river, the O³awa, on the banks of which grey herons may be seen. The route is not marked, which is also why it is recommended in particular for recreational runs for those only just beginning their running adventure.
running The running route between Frog Bridge (¯abia K³adka) and Opatowice Weir (Jaz Opatowicki) measures around 9.5 km. Route surface is varied: from the zoo to Opatowice Weir it is metalled path, from the Opatowice side mainly asphalt. The route is not marked. A panorama of the Oder (Odra) can be admired from Frog Bridge, and the picturesque meanders of the O³awa river contemplated at the Opatowice end.
running The running route in Grabiszyn Park (Park Grabiszyñski) measures 5.3 km. The surface is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 70% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees. Each kilometre is marked, as is running direction.
running Popowice running route measures 5 km. Route surface is varied: in Popowice Park (park Popowicki) metalled paths; on Kozanów Dyke (grobla Kozanowska) asphalt and chippings; on ul. GnieŸnieñska, D³uga and Starogroblowa fully asphalt. The route is intended for intermediate runners.
running We begin the run at the pond near the school; we run through the recreational grounds and follow the metalled path to the north-east. Arriving at the floodbank, we continue along the crown. When we reach the asphalt section we turn right and run to the bridge on the O³awa river. Heading straight on, we run into the woods and then straight on to the rail bridge (the surface for this section is concrete slabs). At the rail bridge we turn left and run along the forest track to the clearing at the lake of Black Backwater (Czarna £acha). There we do a loop, but at the rail bridge we change return direction. We turn left then, after 50 metres, right (avoiding the floodbank). The route runs along the rail embankment. We cross the O³awa river over the footbridge at the next rail bridge and, turning left, head back to the school. 
running The running route in Szczytniki Park (park Szczytnicki) measures 1 km. The route is metalled along its entire length (beyond a 20 m section). The 'Szczytnicki kilometre' can be used for recreational running and advanced training. The route passes the wooden church of St John of Nepomuk. The church dates from the turn of the 17th century.
running Tumski running route measures around 3 km. This is a fully urban route which runs through the city centre along boulevards by the Oder (Odra). Route surface is extremely varied: although beginning with metalled surfaces and ending on stone, it should be emphasized that a majority of the route is a hard stone and asphalt surface. The route commends itself to all who like monuments, the hubbub of the centre and, above all, the unique atmosphere of the oldest part of the city.

hiking Distance: 20 milesDifficulty: ModerateMost of the more than 700 miles of trails in one-million-acre Glacier National Park traverse remote wilderness, requiring a commitment of multiple days backpacking in northern mountains thick with grizzly bears, where weather can shift. But the 20-mile traverse of the Gunsight Pass Trail (lead photo at top of story), from Gunsight Pass Trailhead to Lake McDonald Lodge, is one of the logistically easiest and shortest multi-day hikes in the park. Both trailheads are on the Going-to-the-Sun Road and served by the park’s free shuttle bus. Most of all, though, the hike takes in some of Glacier’s best scenery, including views of one of its largest rivers of ice, the Blackfoot Glacier, scores of waterfalls, and a backcountry campsite at Lake Ellen Wilson that is one of the prettiest in the park.Spread it out over four days and add the optional, 7.4-mile, out-and-back side hike to Sperry Glacier. That trail climbs over a barren, rocky landscape more recently deglaciated, and passes through a tight notch in the cliffs at Comeau Pass, to reach an overlook of the Sperry Glacier. Unlike trails around Logan Pass and Many Glacier, this route is also not crowded with dayhikers. I’ve backpacked it twice and both times seen mountain goats near Gunsight Pass. The moderately graded trail never gets terribly steep, so it feels easier than the distances suggest, although the long descent to Lake McDonald is a thigh-pounder; but east to west is still the better direction to hike it, because in the other direction, the day one uphill from Lake McDonald would be a strenuous and long slog. Use poles.
hiking Distance: 37.2 miles (shorter options)Difficulty: ModerateAnyone looking for a five-star introduction to backpacking in Yosemite that hits marquis highlights and is beginner-friendly need look no further than this 37.2-mile loop from Yosemite Valley. From the popular Happy Isles Trailhead at the east end of The Valley, it winds through the core of the park, starting with ascending the Mist Trail past 317-foot Vernal Fall—which rains a heavy mist on hikers—and thunderous, 594-foot Nevada Fall. The distance includes the optional, out-and-back climb of the steep and exposed cable route up Half Dome, where the summit view of Yosemite Valley is arguably only outdone by the view you’ll get later on the hike from a thousand feet higher on the knife-edge summit ridge of Clouds Rest.From a campsite on the edge of the alpine meadows at Sunrise, you’ll get a sweeping view of the granite castles of the Cathedral Range. And the hike, spread over four to five days, follows a couple stretches of the world-famous John Muir Trail, descending it on the last day past a calendar-photo vista of Half Dome, Liberty Cap, and Nevada Fall. Apply early for this permit reservation, especially if you want to spend more than one night camping at Little Yosemite Valley.See my story “Ask Me: Where to Backpack First Time in Yosemite” for a description of this route, and a more-detailed description with complete trip-planning guidance in my e-guide “The Best First Backpacking Trip in Yosemite,” which also covers alternate multi-day hiking itineraries beginning and ending at various trailheads ringing this core area of the park, including routes from Tuolumne Meadows and stunning Tenaya Lake.
hiking Distance: 19.7 milesDifficulty: ModerateThe 19.7-mile loop linking up Paintbrush and Cascade canyons from String Lake offers something of a highlights reel of Grand Teton National Park, and is probably among the most scenic sub-20-mile hikes in the National Park System. With nearly 4,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, the loop crosses the highest point reached via trail in the park, 10,720-foot Paintbrush Divide, where the panorama takes in a jagged skyline featuring some of the highest summits in the Tetons. It also passes by beloved Lake Solitude, nestled in a cirque of cliffs, and below the striped cliffs of Paintbrush Canyon and waterfalls and soaring peaks of Cascade Canyon.We backpacked this popular loop over three days with our kids when they were young, camping at Upper Paintbrush the first night and North Fork Cascade the second, and seeing moose in Cascade Canyon; I’ve also dayhiked it. It can be hiked in either direction—and the Paintbrush side is steeper and more strenuous whether going up or down it. But by going counter-clockwise, you enjoy a steady view of the Grand Teton looming high above the North Fork of Cascade Canyon; and you finish down Cascade Canyon, where most of the group can avoid the final slog through the woods and take the boat shuttle across Jenny Lake—with in-your-face views of the peaks—while someone hikes the last 45 minutes to retrieve the car at String Lake.
hiking Distance: 14 milesDifficulty: EasyOnly in a national park that features The Narrows—which, admittedly, ranks hands-down as one of the best backpacking trips in America and certainly one of the best in the Southwest—could the West Rim Trail be overshadowed. More than a few longtime Zion backcountry denizens have told me the West Rim is their favorite trail in the park—and having dayhiked and backpacked it, I’d say the same. From the plateau on the trail’s upper sections, you overlook a labyrinth of white-walled canyons and green-topped mesas. Then the trail drops about 2,500 feet in 4.7 miles, zigzagging down a cliff face and through a landscape of towering beehive rock formations and walls streaked in vivid burgundy and salmon hues.The approximately 14-mile, one-way, north-to-south, mostly downhill hike from Lava Point on Kolob Terrace Road to the Grotto Trailhead in Zion Canyon—requiring a shuttle (available in Springdale)—can be done in one day by fit hikers. But an overnight at one of the campsites along the West Rim Trail lets you see this incomparable scenery in the glorious light after dawn and at sunset, and makes it a more feasible objective for families and novice backpackers. Add just over a half-mile for the side hike up Angels Landing, one of the most spectacular and iconic summits in the National Park System.
hiking Distance: Multiple optionsDifficulty: EasyOuzel Lake in Wild Basin, Rocky Mountain National Park.In the southeast corner of Rocky Mountain National Park, east of the Continental Divide and south of the park’s tallest and most famous mountain, 14,259-foot Longs Peak, Wild Basin holds a small constellation of mountain lakes rippling below a wall of 12,000- and 13,000-foot peaks. In the forest of ponderosa pine with copses of aspen trees that turn golden in fall, trails reach like the fingers on a hand up creek valleys to access several of the lakes on relatively easy hikes, presenting a variety of route options.From the Wild Basin Trailhead at 8,500 feet, it’s just a few miles gently uphill to creekside campsites like Siskin, on a small creek where my kids played on a family backpacking trip. Six miles in lies Thunder Lake, in a bowl at over 10,500 feet, beneath the rampart of the Divide. The best camp we had was the lone site at Ouzel Lake, a jewel at about 10,000 feet ringed by pine forest below more soaring peaks. From there, our hike out consisted of an easy 4.7 miles downhill. While parts of Wild Basin get significant dayhiker traffic, Ouzel Lake and Thunder Lake both lie far enough from the trailhead to see fewer dayhikers, and you’ll enjoy quiet evenings and mornings of glassy water to yourself.
running The running route between the Jagiellonian Bridges (mosty Jagielloñskie) and Swojczyce Bridge (most Swojczycki) is c. 6 km. The surface of the route, beyond bridge sections (c. 300 m), is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 90% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees, which line both sides of the boulevard. Each kilometre is marked, useful in measuring running speed.
running The running route measures 5 km. The surface of the route is 60% paving stone and 40% chippings. The loop extends between three bridges: Szczytniki Bridge (most Szczytnicki), Jagiellonian Bridge (most Jagielloñski) and Warsaw Bridge (most Warszawski). The whole of the route runs along the floodbank. The route is flat and surfaced, making it very well suited to beginners.
running The running route in East Park (park Wschodni) is a loop of a length of 3 km. The surface of the route is metalled, with slight ascents surfaced with paving stone occurring on bridges. The route is extremely picturesque, with long sections beside a river, the O³awa, on the banks of which grey herons may be seen. The route is not marked, which is also why it is recommended in particular for recreational runs for those only just beginning their running adventure.
running The running route between Frog Bridge (¯abia K³adka) and Opatowice Weir (Jaz Opatowicki) measures around 9.5 km. Route surface is varied: from the zoo to Opatowice Weir it is metalled path, from the Opatowice side mainly asphalt. The route is not marked. A panorama of the Oder (Odra) can be admired from Frog Bridge, and the picturesque meanders of the O³awa river contemplated at the Opatowice end.
running The running route in Grabiszyn Park (Park Grabiszyñski) measures 5.3 km. The surface is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 70% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees. Each kilometre is marked, as is running direction.
running Popowice running route measures 5 km. Route surface is varied: in Popowice Park (park Popowicki) metalled paths; on Kozanów Dyke (grobla Kozanowska) asphalt and chippings; on ul. GnieŸnieñska, D³uga and Starogroblowa fully asphalt. The route is intended for intermediate runners.
running We begin the run at the pond near the school; we run through the recreational grounds and follow the metalled path to the north-east. Arriving at the floodbank, we continue along the crown. When we reach the asphalt section we turn right and run to the bridge on the O³awa river. Heading straight on, we run into the woods and then straight on to the rail bridge (the surface for this section is concrete slabs). At the rail bridge we turn left and run along the forest track to the clearing at the lake of Black Backwater (Czarna £acha). There we do a loop, but at the rail bridge we change return direction. We turn left then, after 50 metres, right (avoiding the floodbank). The route runs along the rail embankment. We cross the O³awa river over the footbridge at the next rail bridge and, turning left, head back to the school. 
running The running route in Szczytniki Park (park Szczytnicki) measures 1 km. The route is metalled along its entire length (beyond a 20 m section). The 'Szczytnicki kilometre' can be used for recreational running and advanced training. The route passes the wooden church of St John of Nepomuk. The church dates from the turn of the 17th century.
running Tumski running route measures around 3 km. This is a fully urban route which runs through the city centre along boulevards by the Oder (Odra). Route surface is extremely varied: although beginning with metalled surfaces and ending on stone, it should be emphasized that a majority of the route is a hard stone and asphalt surface. The route commends itself to all who like monuments, the hubbub of the centre and, above all, the unique atmosphere of the oldest part of the city.
running The running route in West Park (park Zachodni) extends between Orbit hall (hala Orbita) and KozanÃ³w. Route length is around 4.5 km. Route surface is varied: around 2.5 km is metalled, 1 km asphalt and 1 km paving stone. The route features two ascents and one descent. Owing to the variation in the surface, ascents and descents the route is intended more for intermediate and advanced runners.
cycling At the moderately famous Col de la Faucille is the main road back to Geneva. It’s not my favourite – traffic, including lots of trucks on weekdays – as it is a main short cut from Geneva to Dijon. Mathias climbs it fairly frequently, so I decided to show him a better, nearby, deserted-but-paved alternative via Col de Combe Blanche. See the map to find this road. Basically cycle the main road from Faucille away from Geneva and head to La Vattay. This is one of my favourite cross-country ski stations. At La Vattay, turn in on the only paved road, and just follow. This heads all the way down the Jura mountains – and don’t expect to see more than a car or two. It’s a fantastic alternative.
cycling This very quiet Jura loop climbs three cols and passes two others (Col de Bérentin; Col de Colliard). It is in the same massif – but to the north – of the tougher and better known Grand Colombier, and Col de la Biche.  While not the steepest roads, this route is almost always going either up or down. At the top of the first climb, Col de Cuvéry, is Plateau de Retord – one of my favourite cross country ski locations. But the snow has finally melted.  I consciously designed this loop counter-clockwise as it lets me descend Col de Bérentin (and its tunnel – I hate uphill tunnels). And it also lets me climb the very fun little road to Col de Belleroche. There was a sign near the bottom saying the road way closed in 3kms, I was worried there might still be snow on this north-facing forest route. But still decided to have a look. No snow, they just haven’t yet got around to cleaning the road of winter debris. Fortunately, at the speed I climb, it was easy enough to avoid any rocks or branches: After Col de Belleroche things get easier. On a sparsely populated plateau the route gently descends for 15 or so kilometres before re-entering the woods and climbing the easier side of Col de Richemond – there was still some road graffiti visible from the 2012 Tour de France.  The descent from Richemond is not too technical, and thus fun even for me, winding through the woods. This is classic Jura mountains cycling: A hilly route where you will see more kilometre markers than cars.  
cycling A scenic loop up and over the Massif de la Chambotte, in the French Jura mountains, on extremely quiet roads. Fantastic.  My friend Chris and I debated here whether the Chambotte massif is in fact a Jura (geologically yes) or an Alp (geographically yes). Starting from bustling Rumilly it takes about two minutes to escape traffic and begin the climb up the east side of Col du Clergeon. It’s 15 kilometres to the summit, but that includes some downhill.  Leaving the pastures, through the higher woods, are a few steep kilometres, before finally reaching the Col on a plateau near the summit of Mont Clergeon. The west side faces the redoubtable Grand Colombier and is shorter, thus steeper, with more hairpins – I descended very slowly. Details climbing the west side (plus an ascent of nearby Col du Sapenay) – are here.  As shown on the map below, I descended to just above the main road, taking a quieter route traversing vineyards to the start of Col de la Chambotte.  This is not the toughest climb (360 metres of ascent) but it’s beautiful: climbing on a narrow road with cliffs on the left and Lac du Bourget on the right. Highly recommended.

Tunnel near Chambotte View from Chambotte Looking back  Nice road After reaching Col de la Chambotte, there is still some more uphill as I headed towards Cessens. Finally, a great 10 kilometre descent back to Rumilly, not too steep, on narrow winding roads.  This route is perfect for reducing one’s blood pressure. Quiet, scenic, well surfaced. A pleasure.   Note, perhaps three kilometres of the descent were covered in fine gravel. Apparently the construction work will be complete by end April- annoying but I survived on a road bike.  Here is one more route idea. From a couple of years ago, it climbs the same east side of Col du Clergeon returning by Col du Sapenay:
cycling The well-known, but thoroughly over-rated, Col de la Faucille is nearby. But La Barillette is one of several far more interesting, higher, virtually car-free, well paved, steep climbs in this section of the Jura mountains. Also see Col de la Vattay, and La Baudichonne.  Sections of the climb are one-way on the way up, with different one-way stretches for the descent. Today, there was only one possible way up. A combination of uphill stretches and going the wrong way on the descent stretches. See map below to take the correct turns and avoid doubling back. In summer — just follow the signs to La Dôle. As I got higher, it was chillier and plenty of snow. But except for one stretch near the summit, the road was dry and clear.
cycling Despite its great name, I had never cycled to La Vue des Alpes – in part because someone had once told me the road – while wide – could have some fast traffic. The Juras are full of deserted, fun, little forest roads. So I decided do a little research and see if I could find a quieter route to the summit.  The Switzerland Mobility web site is full of useful “official” information on the 9 Swiss National cycling routes, the 3 National mountain-bike routes, and countless regional routes. Lo and Behold, Stage 3 of the Nord-Vaudois-Jura (#22) regional bike route climbs to La Vue des Alpes via quiet, paved roads – perfect. Details here. Note, the profile above is for the direct, main road to Vue des Alpes (I assume some road cyclists will be interested), but my route up was longer and more “un-even”. I started from Corcelles train station (see map below), quickly finding the signs for regional cycling route 22. The first several kilometres climb through a thick forest on a narrow, well paved road. Fantastic: Similar to the nearby excellent climb to Chasseral (its distinctive summit was frequently in view), the route consists of two climbs on forest roads – split by a long flatter stretch through an open bucolic plateau.  The 2nd uphill stretch begins with a sign warning of hard work ahead: There are several super steep short stretches as the route contorts to avoid the main road. It then enters the Tete de Ran ski area. It’s a fabulous, typical little single lane Jura farm road: The high point of the route is beside the Tete de Ran – above 1300 metres – and then it’s a 2 kilometre slight descent to La Vue des Alpes (1283 metres). The Alps views can be stunning from any Jura peak, but it depends on the clarity – and today was a little hazy. So please use your imagination when looking at the top photo in this post. ??  Descending the other side, I again departed from the main road and followed route 22 signs. But when I reached the bottom, I left this route and joined the also-well-signed National Route #7 (Juras). The next 17 or 18 kilometres are great. Much on single lane farm roads open only to locals. I only passed tractors. Finally, I left National Route #7 and turned up towards Col de la Tourne. This is a “normal” wide 2 lane road. But Swiss quiet. This was the easy side of Col de la Tourne, but the descent is great (it’s 15 kms downhill to Lac Neuchâtel), on a well surfaced road. A future climb project? View from Col de la Tourne I was very pleased with this loop. The first 2/3’s is virtually traffic free on pleasant, adequate quality little roads. The final 1/3, while having a small amount of traffic, was a fun descent. Excellent.
hiking Distance: 20 miles Difficulty: Moderate  Most of the more than 700 miles of trails in one-million-acre Glacier National Park traverse remote wilderness, requiring a commitment of multiple days backpacking in northern mountains thick with grizzly bears, where weather can shift. But the 20-mile traverse of the Gunsight Pass Trail (lead photo at top of story), from Gunsight Pass Trailhead to Lake McDonald Lodge, is one of the logistically easiest and shortest multi-day hikes in the park. Both trailheads are on the Going-to-the-Sun Road and served by the park’s free shuttle bus. Most of all, though, the hike takes in some of Glacier’s best scenery, including views of one of its largest rivers of ice, the Blackfoot Glacier, scores of waterfalls, and a backcountry campsite at Lake Ellen Wilson that is one of the prettiest in the park.  Spread it out over four days and add the optional, 7.4-mile, out-and-back side hike to Sperry Glacier. That trail climbs over a barren, rocky landscape more recently deglaciated, and passes through a tight notch in the cliffs at Comeau Pass, to reach an overlook of the Sperry Glacier. Unlike trails around Logan Pass and Many Glacier, this route is also not crowded with dayhikers. I’ve backpacked it twice and both times seen mountain goats near Gunsight Pass. The moderately graded trail never gets terribly steep, so it feels easier than the distances suggest, although the long descent to Lake McDonald is a thigh-pounder; but east to west is still the better direction to hike it, because in the other direction, the day one uphill from Lake McDonald would be a strenuous and long slog. Use poles.
hiking Distance: 37.2 miles (shorter options) Difficulty: Moderate Anyone looking for a five-star introduction to backpacking in Yosemite that hits marquis highlights and is beginner-friendly need look no further than this 37.2-mile loop from Yosemite Valley. From the popular Happy Isles Trailhead at the east end of The Valley, it winds through the core of the park, starting with ascending the Mist Trail past 317-foot Vernal Fall—which rains a heavy mist on hikers—and thunderous, 594-foot Nevada Fall. The distance includes the optional, out-and-back climb of the steep and exposed cable route up Half Dome, where the summit view of Yosemite Valley is arguably only outdone by the view you’ll get later on the hike from a thousand feet higher on the knife-edge summit ridge of Clouds Rest.  From a campsite on the edge of the alpine meadows at Sunrise, you’ll get a sweeping view of the granite castles of the Cathedral Range. And the hike, spread over four to five days, follows a couple stretches of the world-famous John Muir Trail, descending it on the last day past a calendar-photo vista of Half Dome, Liberty Cap, and Nevada Fall. Apply early for this permit reservation, especially if you want to spend more than one night camping at Little Yosemite Valley.  See my story “Ask Me: Where to Backpack First Time in Yosemite” for a description of this route, and a more-detailed description with complete trip-planning guidance in my e-guide “The Best First Backpacking Trip in Yosemite,” which also covers alternate multi-day hiking itineraries beginning and ending at various trailheads ringing this core area of the park, including routes from Tuolumne Meadows and stunning Tenaya Lake.

We backpacked this popular loop over three days with our kids when they were young, camping at Upper Paintbrush the first night and North Fork Cascade the second, and seeing moose in Cascade Canyon; I’ve also dayhiked it. It can be hiked in either direction—and the Paintbrush side is steeper and more strenuous whether going up or down it. But by going counter-clockwise, you enjoy a steady view of the Grand Teton looming high above the North Fork of Cascade Canyon; and you finish down Cascade Canyon, where most of the group can avoid the final slog through the woods and take the boat shuttle across Jenny Lake—with in-your-face views of the peaks—while someone hikes the last 45 minutes to retrieve the car at String Lake.

The approximately 14-mile, one-way, north-to-south, mostly downhill hike from Lava Point on Kolob Terrace Road to the Grotto Trailhead in Zion Canyon—requiring a shuttle (available in Springdale)—can be done in one day by fit hikers. But an overnight at one of the campsites along the West Rim Trail lets you see this incomparable scenery in the glorious light after dawn and at sunset, and makes it a more feasible objective for families and novice backpackers. Add just over a half-mile for the side hike up Angels Landing, one of the most spectacular and iconic summits in the National Park System.
hiking Distance: Multiple options Difficulty: Easy  Ouzel Lake in Wild Basin, Rocky Mountain National Park.  In the southeast corner of Rocky Mountain National Park, east of the Continental Divide and south of the park’s tallest and most famous mountain, 14,259-foot Longs Peak, Wild Basin holds a small constellation of mountain lakes rippling below a wall of 12,000- and 13,000-foot peaks. In the forest of ponderosa pine with copses of aspen trees that turn golden in fall, trails reach like the fingers on a hand up creek valleys to access several of the lakes on relatively easy hikes, presenting a variety of route options.  From the Wild Basin Trailhead at 8,500 feet, it’s just a few miles gently uphill to creekside campsites like Siskin, on a small creek where my kids played on a family backpacking trip. Six miles in lies Thunder Lake, in a bowl at over 10,500 feet, beneath the rampart of the Divide.

cycling A scenic loop up and over the Massif de la Chambotte, in the French Jura mountains, on extremely quiet roads. Fantastic.  My friend Chris and I debated here whether the Chambotte massif is in fact a Jura (geologically yes) or an Alp (geographically yes). Starting from bustling Rumilly it takes about two minutes to escape traffic and begin the climb up the east side of Col du Clergeon. It’s 15 kilometres to the summit, but that includes some downhill.  Leaving the pastures, through the higher woods, are a few steep kilometres, before finally reaching the Col on a plateau near the summit of Mont Clergeon. The west side faces the redoubtable Grand Colombier and is shorter, thus steeper, with more hairpins – I descended very slowly. Details climbing the west side (plus an ascent of nearby Col du Sapenay) – are here.  As shown on the map below, I descended to just above the main road, taking a quieter route traversing vineyards to the start of Col de la Chambotte.  This is not the toughest climb (360 metres of ascent) but it’s beautiful: climbing on a narrow road with cliffs on the left and Lac du Bourget on the right. Highly recommended.

The start Col du Clergeon West side of Clergeon  Promising sign - narrow road As shown on the map below, I descended to just above the main road, taking a quieter route traversing vineyards to the start of Col de la Chambotte.  This is not the toughest climb (360 metres of ascent) but it’s beautiful: climbing on a narrow road with cliffs on the left and Lac du Bourget on the right. Highly recommended.     Tunnel near Chambotte View from Chambotte Looking back  Nice road After reaching Col de la Chambotte, there is still some more uphill as I headed towards Cessens. Finally, a great 10 kilometre descent back to Rumilly, not too steep, on narrow winding roads.  This route is perfect for reducing one’s blood pressure. Quiet, scenic, well surfaced. A pleasure.   Note, perhaps three kilometres of the descent were covered in fine gravel. Apparently the construction work will be complete by end April- annoying but I survived on a road bike.  Here is one more route idea. From a couple of years ago, it climbs the same east side of Col du Clergeon returning by Col du Sapenay:
cycling The well-known, but thoroughly over-rated, Col de la Faucille is nearby. But La Barillette is one of several far more interesting, higher, virtually car-free, well paved, steep climbs in this section of the Jura mountains. Also see Col de la Vattay, and La Baudichonne.  Sections of the climb are one-way on the way up, with different one-way stretches for the descent. Today, there was only one possible way up. A combination of uphill stretches and going the wrong way on the descent stretches. See map below to take the correct turns and avoid doubling back. In summer — just follow the signs to La Dôle. As I got higher, it was chillier and plenty of snow. But except for one stretch near the summit, the road was dry and clear.
cycling Despite its great name, I had never cycled to La Vue des Alpes – in part because someone had once told me the road – while wide – could have some fast traffic. The Juras are full of deserted, fun, little forest roads. So I decided do a little research and see if I could find a quieter route to the summit.  The Switzerland Mobility web site is full of useful “official” information on the 9 Swiss National cycling routes, the 3 National mountain-bike routes, and countless regional routes. Lo and Behold, Stage 3 of the Nord-Vaudois-Jura (#22) regional bike route climbs to La Vue des Alpes via quiet, paved roads – perfect. Details here. Note, the profile above is for the direct, main road to Vue des Alpes (I assume some road cyclists will be interested), but my route up was longer and more “un-even”. I started from Corcelles train station (see map below), quickly finding the signs for regional cycling route 22. The first several kilometres climb through a thick forest on a narrow, well paved road. Fantastic: Similar to the nearby excellent climb to Chasseral (its distinctive summit was frequently in view), the route consists of two climbs on forest roads – split by a long flatter stretch through an open bucolic plateau.  The 2nd uphill stretch begins with a sign warning of hard work ahead: There are several super steep short stretches as the route contorts to avoid the main road. It then enters the Tete de Ran ski area. It’s a fabulous, typical little single lane Jura farm road: The high point of the route is beside the Tete de Ran – above 1300 metres – and then it’s a 2 kilometre slight descent to La Vue des Alpes (1283 metres). The Alps views can be stunning from any Jura peak, but it depends on the clarity – and today was a little hazy. So please use your imagination when looking at the top photo in this post. ??  Descending the other side, I again departed from the main road and followed route 22 signs. But when I reached the bottom, I left this route and joined the also-well-signed National Route #7 (Juras). The next 17 or 18 kilometres are great. Much on single lane farm roads open only to locals. I only passed tractors. Finally, I left National Route #7 and turned up towards Col de la Tourne. This is a “normal” wide 2 lane road. But Swiss quiet. This was the easy side of Col de la Tourne, but the descent is great (it’s 15 kms downhill to Lac Neuchâtel), on a well surfaced road. A future climb project? View from Col de la Tourne I was very pleased with this loop. The first 2/3’s is virtually traffic free on pleasant, adequate quality little roads. The final 1/3, while having a small amount of traffic, was a fun descent. Excellent.
hiking Distance: 20 miles Difficulty: Moderate  Most of the more than 700 miles of trails in one-million-acre Glacier National Park traverse remote wilderness, requiring a commitment of multiple days backpacking in northern mountains thick with grizzly bears, where weather can shift. But the 20-mile traverse of the Gunsight Pass Trail (lead photo at top of story), from Gunsight Pass Trailhead to Lake McDonald Lodge, is one of the logistically easiest and shortest multi-day hikes in the park. Both trailheads are on the Going-to-the-Sun Road and served by the park’s free shuttle bus. Most of all, though, the hike takes in some of Glacier’s best scenery, including views of one of its largest rivers of ice, the Blackfoot Glacier, scores of waterfalls, and a backcountry campsite at Lake Ellen Wilson that is one of the prettiest in the park.  Spread it out over four days and add the optional, 7.4-mile, out-and-back side hike to Sperry Glacier. That trail climbs over a barren, rocky landscape more recently deglaciated, and passes through a tight notch in the cliffs at Comeau Pass, to reach an overlook of the Sperry Glacier. Unlike trails around Logan Pass and Many Glacier, this route is also not crowded with dayhikers. I’ve backpacked it twice and both times seen mountain goats near Gunsight Pass. The moderately graded trail never gets terribly steep, so it feels easier than the distances suggest, although the long descent to Lake McDonald is a thigh-pounder; but east to west is still the better direction to hike it, because in the other direction, the day one uphill from Lake McDonald would be a strenuous and long slog. Use poles.
hiking Distance: 37.2 miles (shorter options) Difficulty: Moderate Anyone looking for a five-star introduction to backpacking in Yosemite that hits marquis highlights and is beginner-friendly need look no further than this 37.2-mile loop from Yosemite Valley. From the popular Happy Isles Trailhead at the east end of The Valley, it winds through the core of the park, starting with ascending the Mist Trail past 317-foot Vernal Fall—which rains a heavy mist on hikers—and thunderous, 594-foot Nevada Fall. The distance includes the optional, out-and-back climb of the steep and exposed cable route up Half Dome, where the summit view of Yosemite Valley is arguably only outdone by the view you’ll get later on the hike from a thousand feet higher on the knife-edge summit ridge of Clouds Rest.  From a campsite on the edge of the alpine meadows at Sunrise, you’ll get a sweeping view of the granite castles of the Cathedral Range. And the hike, spread over four to five days, follows a couple stretches of the world-famous John Muir Trail, descending it on the last day past a calendar-photo vista of Half Dome, Liberty Cap, and Nevada Fall. Apply early for this permit reservation, especially if you want to spend more than one night camping at Little Yosemite Valley.  See my story “Ask Me: Where to Backpack First Time in Yosemite” for a description of this route, and a more-detailed description with complete trip-planning guidance in my e-guide “The Best First Backpacking Trip in Yosemite,” which also covers alternate multi-day hiking itineraries beginning and ending at various trailheads ringing this core area of the park, including routes from Tuolumne Meadows and stunning Tenaya Lake.
hiking Distance: 19.7 miles Difficulty: Moderate The 19.7-mile loop linking up Paintbrush and Cascade canyons from String Lake offers something of a highlights reel of Grand Teton National Park, and is probably among the most scenic sub-20-mile hikes in the National Park System. With nearly 4,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, the loop crosses the highest point reached via trail in the park, 10,720-foot Paintbrush Divide, where the panorama takes in a jagged skyline featuring some of the highest summits in the Tetons. It also passes by beloved Lake Solitude, nestled in a cirque of cliffs, and below the striped cliffs of Paintbrush Canyon and waterfalls and soaring peaks of Cascade Canyon.  We backpacked this popular loop over three days with our kids when they were young, camping at Upper Paintbrush the first night and North Fork Cascade the second, and seeing moose in Cascade Canyon; I’ve also dayhiked it. It can be hiked in either direction—and the Paintbrush side is steeper and more strenuous whether going up or down it. But by going counter-clockwise, you enjoy a steady view of the Grand Teton looming high above the North Fork of Cascade Canyon; and you finish down Cascade Canyon, where most of the group can avoid the final slog through the woods and take the boat shuttle across Jenny Lake—with in-your-face views of the peaks—while someone hikes the last 45 minutes to retrieve the car at String Lake.
hiking Distance: 14 miles Difficulty: Easy Only in a national park that features The Narrows—which, admittedly, ranks hands-down as one of the best backpacking trips in America and certainly one of the best in the Southwest—could the West Rim Trail be overshadowed. More than a few longtime Zion backcountry denizens have told me the West Rim is their favorite trail in the park—and having dayhiked and backpacked it, I’d say the same. From the plateau on the trail’s upper sections, you overlook a labyrinth of white-walled canyons and green-topped mesas. Then the trail drops about 2,500 feet in 4.7 miles, zigzagging down a cliff face and through a landscape of towering beehive rock formations and walls streaked in vivid burgundy and salmon hues.  The approximately 14-mile, one-way, north-to-south, mostly downhill hike from Lava Point on Kolob Terrace Road to the Grotto Trailhead in Zion Canyon—requiring a shuttle (available in Springdale)—can be done in one day by fit hikers. But an overnight at one of the campsites along the West Rim Trail lets you see this incomparable scenery in the glorious light after dawn and at sunset, and makes it a more feasible objective for families and novice backpackers. Add just over a half-mile for the side hike up Angels Landing, one of the most spectacular and iconic summits in the National Park System.
hiking Distance: Multiple options Difficulty: Easy  Ouzel Lake in Wild Basin, Rocky Mountain National Park.  In the southeast corner of Rocky Mountain National Park, east of the Continental Divide and south of the park’s tallest and most famous mountain, 14,259-foot Longs Peak, Wild Basin holds a small constellation of mountain lakes rippling below a wall of 12,000- and 13,000-foot peaks. In the forest of ponderosa pine with copses of aspen trees that turn golden in fall, trails reach like the fingers on a hand up creek valleys to access several of the lakes on relatively easy hikes, presenting a variety of route options.  From the Wild Basin Trailhead at 8,500 feet, it’s just a few miles gently uphill to creekside campsites like Siskin, on a small creek where my kids played on a family backpacking trip. Six miles in lies Thunder Lake, in a bowl at over 10,500 feet, beneath the rampart of the Divide. The best camp we had was the lone site at Ouzel Lake, a jewel at about 10,000 feet ringed by pine forest below more soaring peaks. From there, our hike out consisted of an easy 4.7 miles downhill. While parts of Wild Basin get significant dayhiker traffic, Ouzel Lake and Thunder Lake both lie far enough from the trailhead to see fewer dayhikers, and you’ll enjoy quiet evenings and mornings of glassy water to yourself.
running The running route between the Jagiellonian Bridges (mosty Jagielloñskie) and Swojczyce Bridge (most Swojczycki) is c. 6 km. The surface of the route, beyond bridge sections (c. 300 m), is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 90% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees, which line both sides of the boulevard. Each kilometre is marked, useful in measuring running speed.
running The running route measures 5 km. The surface of the route is 60% paving stone and 40% chippings. The loop extends between three bridges: Szczytniki Bridge (most Szczytnicki), Jagiellonian Bridge (most Jagielloñski) and Warsaw Bridge (most Warszawski). The whole of the route runs along the floodbank. The route is flat and surfaced, making it very well suited to beginners.
running The running route in East Park (park Wschodni) is a loop of a length of 3 km. The surface of the route is metalled, with slight ascents surfaced with paving stone occurring on bridges. The route is extremely picturesque, with long sections beside a river, the O³awa, on the banks of which grey herons may be seen. The route is not marked, which is also why it is recommended in particular for recreational runs for those only just beginning their running adventure.
running The running route between Frog Bridge (¯abia K³adka) and Opatowice Weir (Jaz Opatowicki) measures around 9.5 km. Route surface is varied: from the zoo to Opatowice Weir it is metalled path, from the Opatowice side mainly asphalt. The route is not marked. A panorama of the Oder (Odra) can be admired from Frog Bridge, and the picturesque meanders of the O³awa river contemplated at the Opatowice end.
running The running route in Grabiszyn Park (Park Grabiszyñski) measures 5.3 km. The surface is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 70% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees. Each kilometre is marked, as is running direction.
running Popowice running route measures 5 km. Route surface is varied: in Popowice Park (park Popowicki) metalled paths; on Kozanów Dyke (grobla Kozanowska) asphalt and chippings; on ul. GnieŸnieñska, D³uga and Starogroblowa fully asphalt. The route is intended for intermediate runners.
running We begin the run at the pond near the school; we run through the recreational grounds and follow the metalled path to the north-east. Arriving at the floodbank, we continue along the crown. When we reach the asphalt section we turn right and run to the bridge on the O³awa river. Heading straight on, we run into the woods and then straight on to the rail bridge (the surface for this section is concrete slabs). At the rail bridge we turn left and run along the forest track to the clearing at the lake of Black Backwater (Czarna £acha). There we do a loop, but at the rail bridge we change return direction. We turn left then, after 50 metres, right (avoiding the floodbank). The route runs along the rail embankment. We cross the O³awa river over the footbridge at the next rail bridge and, turning left, head back to the school. 
running The running route in Szczytniki Park (park Szczytnicki) measures 1 km. The route is metalled along its entire length (beyond a 20 m section). The 'Szczytnicki kilometre' can be used for recreational running and advanced training. The route passes the wooden church of St John of Nepomuk. The church dates from the turn of the 17th century.
running Tumski running route measures around 3 km. This is a fully urban route which runs through the city centre along boulevards by the Oder (Odra). Route surface is extremely varied: although beginning with metalled surfaces and ending on stone, it should be emphasized that a majority of the route is a hard stone and asphalt surface. The route commends itself to all who like monuments, the hubbub of the centre and, above all, the unique atmosphere of the oldest part of the city.
running The running route in West Park (park Zachodni) extends between Orbit hall (hala Orbita) and KozanÃ³w. Route length is around 4.5 km. Route surface is varied: around 2.5 km is metalled, 1 km asphalt and 1 km paving stone. The route features two ascents and one descent. Owing to the variation in the surface, ascents and descents the route is intended more for intermediate and advanced runners.
