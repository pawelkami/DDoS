The running route between the Jagiellonian Bridges (mosty Jagielloñskie) and Swojczyce Bridge (most Swojczycki) is c. 6 km. The surface of the route, beyond bridge sections (c. 300 m), is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 90% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees, which line both sides of the boulevard. Each kilometre is marked, useful in measuring running speed.
