PROVING GROUND OF THE GREATS
The road from Cortina to Ortisei is not for those weak of leg or lung. Two regions, three high Alpine passes (including the legendary Pordoi), and innumerable hairpin turns mark its route amid the jagged spires of Italy’s most striking mountain range. Funny thing is, the sheer exhilaration of the scenery, and the camaraderie of the fellow cyclists who flock here on pilgrimage often brings an energy that makes those switchbacks feel almost—almost—like they’re downhill.
