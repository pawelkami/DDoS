Starting to rain, brrrrr
I’d like to think I have one cycling talent: the ability to find quiet, interesting roads. But not every ride can be a favourite.
Passo Foscagno is beautiful, high, long, etc. But it has a bit too much traffic for me to recommend it with much enthusiasm. It’s a big road, clearly designed to get motor vehicles up and over the mountains. Things never felt dangerous, but, in addition to cars, I was probably passed by 30 or 40 trucks. Oh, and avalanche tunnels near the top.

From Bormio, follow the road in the direction to Passo dello Stelvio, and immediately after the first Stelvio hairpin (signed as #40), turn left. There is a Passo Foscagno open/closed sign almost immediately. Early on, the route passes the beginning of the fabulous hairpin-filled climb to Torri di Fraele – highly recommended.

Strangely, I forgot to check the weather. In my mind, it would be a perfect day. But it started very lightly raining as I approached the pass and the sky was very threatening ahead.
I had planned to ride beyond Passo Foscagno and visit the nearby Passo d’Eira (2208m), and then Forcola di Livigno (2312m) on the Swiss border. But with the weather, the two previous days in my legs, and the traffic – I decided to just turn around and descend. I’ve marked the other two passes on the map below so at least you can ride them.

The weather was probably ultimately more-than-fine, and I hate quitting on a ride, but no harm done. I still enjoyed myself.

A beautiful climb with just a touch too much traffic for my taste.
