Tumski running route measures around 3 km. This is a fully urban route which runs through the city centre along boulevards by the Oder (Odra). Route surface is extremely varied: although beginning with metalled surfaces and ending on stone, it should be emphasized that a majority of the route is a hard stone and asphalt surface. The route commends itself to all who like monuments, the hubbub of the centre and, above all, the unique atmosphere of the oldest part of the city.
