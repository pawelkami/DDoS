The running route in Grabiszyn Park (Park Grabiszy√±ski) measures 5.3 km. The surface is metalled, making it ideally suited for both recreational and professional running. As much as 70% of the route enjoys some shelter from wind and sun thanks to the tall trees. Each kilometre is marked, as is running direction.
