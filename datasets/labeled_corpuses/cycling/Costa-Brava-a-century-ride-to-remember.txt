One of the grandest Spanish rides is in Costa Brava, where your two-wheeled adventure starts in Pubol. The hard work on the hills is rewarded with views of small bays with turquoise waters along the coast…with plenty of opportunities to take a dip in the Mediterranean along the way! Riding through the medieval village of Pals adds to the magic of this epic ride which you can experience on our Costa Brava bike trip.
