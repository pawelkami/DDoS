The sun’s dazzling rays slowly filter through the dense spruce and pine branches; fresh snow muffles every noise; the only sound to be heard is that of snow crunching underfoot. The majestic mountain peaks of Tirol stretch out as far as the eye can see – icy-cold and yet heart-warming. There are few experiences like a winter hike on a cold, clear day. Far from the busy slopes and the bustling resorts, visitors will find a wide range of well-maintained and clearly signposted winter hiking trails catering for all ages and abilities. Indeed, within Tirol there are 16 dedicated Winterzauberregionen with networks of winter hiking trails connecting popular vantage points and cosy mountain huts – the ideal place for a drink and a snack in front of a roaring open fire. Experience nature park guides will be happy to tell visitors all about the region’s fauna and flora.
