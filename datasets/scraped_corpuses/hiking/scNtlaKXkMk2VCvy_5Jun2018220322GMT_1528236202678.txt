North, south, east or west â€“ no matter which direction you approach Tirol from, the region's majestic mountain landscape will accompany you throughout your summer holiday in the Heart of the Alps. Did you know that just 13% of the land in Tirol is habitable? The rest is, you guessed it, mountains. Tirol has almost 600 peaks over three kilometres (!) above sea level. But it also has a lot more to offer than "just" towering summits. As well as its many outdoor activities such as hiking, mountainbiking, cycling and rock climbing, it offers visitors the chance to get away from it all and enjoy total peace and quiet. Tirol is also a great place for families and continues to practise centuried-old customs and traditions. For example, there are more village brass bands in Tirol than there are villages! And at the heart of everything going on here are the people, who shape the region, its culture and its famously warm welcome.
