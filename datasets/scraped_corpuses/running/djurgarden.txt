Djurgården (8,9 km)


Link to route in Movescount here

Translated as ‘animals garden,’ Djurgården is a stunning city park that branches off from the old town in the centre of Stockholm and provides an invigorating 10km loop. Starting at the King’s Garden (Kungsträdgården), run along the harbour via Strandvägen, then right over the bridge and into the park.

The route passes by the amusement park, Gröna Lund, and the popular Nordic Museum. There will almost always be some locals on the trails, but never too many. There isn’t too much climb and the trails are broad and well-maintained. Keep to outermost path until Manillavägen where you’ll cross to the other side of the island and make your back to the bridge, then to King’s Garden.

Starting/Finishing Point Note:
King’s Garden is a brilliant place to finish as its beautiful grounds, and numerous outdoor cafes are a welcome sight after a brisk 10 km.
