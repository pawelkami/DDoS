Tuscany – Asciano to Arbia
A LUNAR EXPERIENCE UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN
The magic of Tuscany weaves together rolling hills, medieval towns and meandering roads for an idyllic ride. (Yes, those iconic cypress trees, too.) But you’ll also be astounded at the lunarlike clay landscape, the hilly crete (pronounced cray-tay), leading northwest from Asciano to Siena. We have been riding this otherworldly route on our Tuscany Biking trip for years. It is not to be missed.
