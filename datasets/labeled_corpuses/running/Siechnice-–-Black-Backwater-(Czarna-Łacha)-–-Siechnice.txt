We begin the run at the pond near the school; we run through the recreational grounds and follow the metalled path to the north-east. Arriving at the floodbank, we continue along the crown. When we reach the asphalt section we turn right and run to the bridge on the Oława river. Heading straight on, we run into the woods and then straight on to the rail bridge (the surface for this section is concrete slabs). At the rail bridge we turn left and run along the forest track to the clearing at the lake of Black Backwater (Czarna Łacha). There we do a loop, but at the rail bridge we change return direction. We turn left then, after 50 metres, right (avoiding the floodbank). The route runs along the rail embankment. We cross the Oława river over the footbridge at the next rail bridge and, turning left, head back to the school.
