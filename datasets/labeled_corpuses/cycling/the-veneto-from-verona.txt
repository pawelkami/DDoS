The Veneto
FROM VERONA TO LAKE GARDA
This ride takes you from fair Verona, the home of Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet. Bike a flat path along the lazy Adige River as you wind your way to the vineyards of Custoza, which lend its name to the crisp white wine that is produced here. Onward, the road descends gradually to Valeggio sul Mincio, a well-preserved medieval borgo with an ancient bridge.
