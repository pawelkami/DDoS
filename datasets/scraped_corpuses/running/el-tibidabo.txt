EL TIBIDABO (13,2 KM)


Link to Movescount route here

Description:
Now you’re in for a treat. While the other routes were in the heart of the city, this one will make you earn the best views of the city! This route climbs to the top of el Tibidabo (512 m), starting from a famous trail called "Carretera de les Aigues" – this is also the name of the train station (FGC not Metro) that will bring you to the starting point from the city centre in only 15 minutes. The path starts as gravel and some pavement, and eases you into the run with the first 3–4 km relatively flat. Then you climb. The part of the trail that goes up and and down the mountain is in a loop. Syncing this route and tracking your progress on your Suunto GPS watch is important as the twists and turns are significant.

At the top you’ll find one of the oldest amusement parks in the world, with a classic old ferris wheel and carousel, as well as the beautiful Sacred Heart church. The best views of the city and the sea are from here, whether you’re on of the rides or not. If your quads want to stop here, its possible to have a meal a catch a bus back down, then grab a train back to the centre.

Run during the week for the smallest crowds on the trails and at the top!

Starting Point Note:
Take an FGC (schedules at fgc.cat) train from the centre (Catalunya Station) to the Carretera de les Aigues stop. The trail begins immediately from there heading east (or left as you face the sea). It is generally safe to run at all hours, but if you’re going out early in the morning or later in the evening, bring a headlamp with you as it will be dark on the trails.
