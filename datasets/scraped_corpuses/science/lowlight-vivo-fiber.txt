Open-source, cost-effective system for low-light in vivo fiber photometry
Abstract
Fiber photometry uses genetically encoded optical reporters to link specific cellular activity in stereotaxically targeted brain structures to specific behaviors. There are still a number of barriers that have hindered the widespread adoption of this approach. This includes cost, but also the high-levels of light required to excite the fluorophore, limiting commercial systems to the investigation of short-term transients in neuronal activity to avoid damage of tissue by light. Here, we present a cost-effective optoelectronic system for in vivo fiber photometry that achieves high-sensitivity to changes in fluorescence intensity, enabling detection of optical transients of a popular calcium reporter with excitation powers as low as 100 nW. By realizing a coherent detection scheme and by using a photomultiplier tube as a detector, the system demonstrates reliable study of in vivo neuronal activity, positioning it for future use in the experiments inquiring into learning and memory processes. The system was applied to study stress-evoked calcium transients in corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the mouse hypothalamus.
