Trails, Cobbles and Castles (6,7 km)

Description:
The perfect morning walk or run. Start at the public swimming pool (Eriksdalsbadet) and follow the Södermalm waterfront, cross the canal at the first bridge, and when you arrive on the other side, you’ll be immersed in the beautiful Årsta forest. Here you’ll get a little climb, and earn the best city view from the south. Follow the loop back across the next bridge ahead of you and back to your starting point.

Despite the great location, generally the route is never packed, and the track is mostly paved and suitable for walkers and runners. Try to get out here early in morning for a beautiful, crisp start to your day!

Starting Point Note:
The Public swimming pool is accessible from the train (Skanstull Station) and is walking distance from anywhere in Södermalm.

Finishing Point Note:
When you are done, you’ll want to re-fuel, and if that includes coffee, you’re in the right place, follow Swedenborgsgatan to #7, there you’ll find a brilliant little cafe called Johan & Nyström, which is home to great coffee and they’re open at 07:00 (M-F) so they’re ready for you even if it’s an early run.
