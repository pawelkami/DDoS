VISUAL WONDERS (5,0 KM)


Link to Movescount route here

Description:
Up for some visual wonders? We hope so! You are now in the heart of the city. Follow Passeig de Gracia from the Metro station, warm up slow as you’ll begin to be spoiled with sights. Turn right on Av. Diagonal until Carrer de Provença, follow this until you see the Sagrada Família. We understand if you just want to take a few moments (or hours) here, the surrounding parks provide a brilliant perspective to Gaudi’s masterpiece. You can loop around behind it and back along Carrer de Mallorca. Left towards the sea at Passeig de Sant Joan, and straight to the Arc de Triomf. Boom! You’re done! (Hopefully you didn’t miss La Pedrera, Casa Batlló, Casa de les Puntxes – of course you didn’t because we’ve marked them on the route as POIs!)

Starting Point Note:
This route is easily accessed by Metro as it starts at the Passeig de Gracia station. Begin northwest (away from the sea).

Finishing Point Note:
Your end point is the Arc de Triomf, sublime. Your après-run is well-situated, continue past the arc to the Parc de la Ciutadella. Its beautiful grounds and fountains are the perfect place to relax, do some stretching, and wonder amongst the sculptures and monuments. Also, if you happen to be into comics, a block before the end of the route, along the Passeig Sant Joan @ Carrer Ali Bei, you’ll find a number of shops dedicated only to comics. Grab a coffee and enjoy!
