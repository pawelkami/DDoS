BARCELONA BEACH RUN (9,0 KM)


Link to Movescount route here

Description:
This is truly the local’s route, Barcelona Beach is one of best you’ll see in a city anywhere in the world. This track is well-lit, safe and runnable throughout the year. It can get busy (because it's beautiful) with non-runners in the afternoon, especially in summer so get out there early in the morning to have your path, and your view of the Mediterranean Sea, clear.

The route is an out and back, running parallel to the shoreline, the track is smooth, flat and fast. With an invigorating breeze off the sea, you might be inclined to do some impromptu tempo work. The turn-around is at El Parc del Forum, the city’s most popular spot for outdoor concerts and events. As you’re headed back, run a little past your starting point and you’ll find that this straight-forward run has a sweet ending. You’ll see a main-stay of the beach’s skyline, “the Sail” as the locals call it (W Hotel Barcelona). You are now in one of the most fascinating parts of the city, La Barceloneta, a neighbourhood which was first inhabited by solely by fisherman, is today full of renewed energy and home to countless restaurants and charming little bars.

Starting Point Note:
Taking the Metro to Cuitadella/Vila Olimpica station will place you within a block of the track (Av. del Litoral) which runs along Barcelona Beach (Passeig Maritim del Port Olimpic). You can begin your route anywhere along this path, but we’ve started near Parc del Port Olimpic, so head left as you walk from the Metro station.

Finishing Point Note/Alternative:
On the route we’ve shown you how to return to the start after a short visit of La Barceloneta, another option is to end here, as it is home to all sorts of activities, entertainment and fun you can find rentals for SUP, and the best paella in town, head to Kaiku (Placa del Mar 1, open for lunch and dinner), then stroll back to the start/finish.
