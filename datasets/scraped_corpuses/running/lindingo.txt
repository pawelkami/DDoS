Lidingö – A run on the wild side (29,9 km)


Link to the full route in Movescount here

Description:
This is the spot for a trail run. Lidingö is an island with a full network of trails for running adventures from 4 km to 30 km. It is only minutes from the center of the city, and is home to the most popular trail running events in Stockholm, including the Lidingöloppet, the world’s largest trail race! The race, which began in 1965 with 644 runners is now more than 24,000 runners strong!

The route is full of hills regardless of the distance, including the famous and gruelling ‘Abborbacken hill’ which climbs 46 m in elevation within 550 m. Throughout Lidingö there are stunning views of the city, the sea and the surrounding bays. The final 10km of the full loop is lit, so you can even run this portion at night!

Starting Point Note:
You can get to Lidingö from Gamla Stan via the #13 train to Ropsten, then take bus 203/204/211 to Lidingövallen (Lidingö City stadium).

Alternatives & POIs:
For a shorter variation (22 km) you can skip the first 8km and start from Lidingövallen and head eastwards, this includes the final 10 km known as “sista milen.” In the summer, grab a coffee at the charming, Kaptensstugan, at Klubbvägen 2 which is right along the trail (we’ve marked it as a Cafe POI on the route). 

Finishing Point Note:
Based on the full trail (30 km) or the last 10 km, it is the same Lidingöloppet finish. From here you can walk along Grönsvagäden (south towards the nearby Kyrkviken or ‘Church Bay’) to Lidingövallen (Lidingo City stadium - Kyrkvägen 56). Here you can get changed and have a shower after your adventurous run (M-F 10:00-19:00).

From here (Lidingövallen) grab a 203/204/211 bus to the Ropsten stop + #13 train back to Gamla Stan / city centre.
