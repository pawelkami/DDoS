The well-known, but thoroughly over-rated, Col de la Faucille is nearby. But La Barillette is one of several far more interesting, higher, virtually car-free, well paved, steep climbs in this section of the Jura mountains. Also see Col de la Vattay, and La Baudichonne.

Sections of the climb are one-way on the way up, with different one-way stretches for the descent. Today, there was only one possible way up. A combination of uphill stretches and going the wrong way on the descent stretches. See map below to take the correct turns and avoid doubling back. In summer — just follow the signs to La Dôle.
As I got higher, it was chillier and plenty of snow. But except for one stretch near the summit, the road was dry and clear.
