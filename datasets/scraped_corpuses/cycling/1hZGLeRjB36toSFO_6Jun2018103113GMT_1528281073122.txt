Bike route 689251 – powered by Bikemap 
Sunday was the 5th and last big ride on this Italy / East Swiss trip and one of the best.
Flüelapass is a beautiful and fairly steep 13 kms. Much of the mountains near the top are north facing so a fair bit of snow coverage.

OFENPASS (Pass dal Fuorn)
My legs were ready to go home, but I decided to do one last climb – and what a treat.
Ofenpass is not the hardest of climbs, but most of the route is through the stunning Schweizerischer Nationalpark (Swiss National Park). Very nice!
