The running route in East Park (park Wschodni) is a loop of a length of 3 km. The surface of the route is metalled, with slight ascents surfaced with paving stone occurring on bridges. The route is extremely picturesque, with long sections beside a river, the OÂ³awa, on the banks of which grey herons may be seen. The route is not marked, which is also why it is recommended in particular for recreational runs for those only just beginning their running adventure.
