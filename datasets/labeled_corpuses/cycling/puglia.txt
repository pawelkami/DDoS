TRULLI TIME…UNCOVER THE MYSTERY
The most distinctive and mysterious feature of Puglia are the trulli—conical-roofed stone houses, found in many parts of the Mediterranean. Beginning in the Val d’Itria, ride into Alberobello, the UNESCO-minted “city of trulli” to explore these idiosyncratic structures. This spectacular ride features some rolling hills along the way, followed by an incredible downhill to the sea. Experience it for yourself on our Puglia Biking trip.
