Distance: 20 miles
Difficulty: Moderate

Most of the more than 700 miles of trails in one-million-acre Glacier National Park traverse remote wilderness, requiring a commitment of multiple days backpacking in northern mountains thick with grizzly bears, where weather can shift. But the 20-mile traverse of the Gunsight Pass Trail (lead photo at top of story), from Gunsight Pass Trailhead to Lake McDonald Lodge, is one of the logistically easiest and shortest multi-day hikes in the park. Both trailheads are on the Going-to-the-Sun Road and served by the park’s free shuttle bus. Most of all, though, the hike takes in some of Glacier’s best scenery, including views of one of its largest rivers of ice, the Blackfoot Glacier, scores of waterfalls, and a backcountry campsite at Lake Ellen Wilson that is one of the prettiest in the park.

Spread it out over four days and add the optional, 7.4-mile, out-and-back side hike to Sperry Glacier. That trail climbs over a barren, rocky landscape more recently deglaciated, and passes through a tight notch in the cliffs at Comeau Pass, to reach an overlook of the Sperry Glacier. Unlike trails around Logan Pass and Many Glacier, this route is also not crowded with dayhikers. I’ve backpacked it twice and both times seen mountain goats near Gunsight Pass. The moderately graded trail never gets terribly steep, so it feels easier than the distances suggest, although the long descent to Lake McDonald is a thigh-pounder; but east to west is still the better direction to hike it, because in the other direction, the day one uphill from Lake McDonald would be a strenuous and long slog. Use poles.
