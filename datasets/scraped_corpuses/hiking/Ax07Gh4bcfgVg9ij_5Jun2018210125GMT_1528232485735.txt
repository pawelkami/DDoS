Appalachian Trail Photos
Even though I didn't get very far on the trail, I still took quite a few pictures.  I thought I would post some of them here, in case anyone is interested.

Me at Amicalola Falls State Park

The Max Epperson Shelter (Mile 0.l on the Approach Trail)

Green leaves in February?  Mind = blown

See, they do actually get snow in Georgia (sort of)

Springer Mountain in the distance

The first white blaze

Me sort of posing with the famous sign

Stover Creek Shelter (Mile 2.8)

The interior of the shelter

I spent the early part of the day hiking by this creek
An excellent place to hide a body
The view from Sassafras Mountain
A creek just before Gooch Mountain
Gooch Mountain Shelter (Mile 15.8)

Early the next day
One of the many rocky sections on Blood Mountain

Just past Neels Gap
Whitley Gap

One of my friends will appreciate this
The gradual climb up Blue Mountain
On Rocky Mountain just before sunset
The view from Tray Mountain
The descent to Dick's Creek Gap
Only part of my lunch
My room at the Hiawassee Budget Inn
My first resupply
The climb up Bly Mountain
The North Carolina/Georgia border
A weird looking tree at Bly Gap
I feel bad for whoever they named this trail after




Near the top of Albert Mountain
Descending to Winding Stair Gap
This was all gone in about 20 minutes
My room at the Budget Inn in Franklin
Trekking poles are basically useless when this happens
