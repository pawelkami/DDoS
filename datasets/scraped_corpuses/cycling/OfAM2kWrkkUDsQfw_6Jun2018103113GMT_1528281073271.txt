Starting from Les Contamines-Montjoie ski station, this is a great unpaved climb dominated by nearby Mont Blanc. It’s occasionally very steep, but quiet, beautiful, and high – reaching above 2400 metres.
Moo Productions is back!
OK, it’s not that exciting, but this is the first video I’ve made in a while. Note, there are a few sections using drone video – my first attempt. Look at the 1’35” point of the video and see how impressively steady the drone remains while filming.
(I enjoyed that music)
The climb reaches Col du Joly at 1989 metres, and then takes a gravel extension up to l’Aguille Croche (2487 metres) – the road ends perhaps 40 metres below the Aguille at the top of a ski lift. Near here, I would take a half kilometre of trail to reach the crazy-fun ridge where I took several photos before turning around (see map at bottom).
The far (west) side of Col du Joly is a great paved climb starting in Beaufort – see here.
Here are some more photos. First a few taken with the drone:

The descent is fabulous too
Some old school (no drone) photos:
roughly 2420 metres
Yes, I continue to have fun with the drone. This was my first attempt at video with it. I was very impressed with the steadiness and quality of the video. But with a ride as beautiful as this, it’s tough to get terrible images.
