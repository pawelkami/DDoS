In the early 1990's the first bike marathons in Poland were organized in Szklarska Poreba. The growing interest in the competition meant gaverise to accompanying events. After several years, the informal meetings of MTB cyclists turned into the Bike Festival, which continuously takes place in mid-August. The area under the lower cableway station on Szrenica turns into a bicycle town for several days. Still, the most important event is the cycling marathon with the famous, grueling driveway to the Petrowka. But enthusiasts of downhill cycling and acrobatics do come to Szklarska Poreba as well. There is no shortage of BMX performances, and the event is accompanied by the largest bicycle trade fair in Poland. Dozens of exhibitors presenting what is the latest novelty in bicycles. You can buy everything that is necessary for all kinds of cycling sports, from extreme downhill to ordinary equipment for a tourist-cyclist. The event is accompanied by a video review of cycling.
The final event is Sunday's diving competition. The length of the jump is not important however; the brilliance is. The judges decide who wins, and the audience applauds the rewarded cyclists-jumpers.
Bike Festival in Szklarska Poreba is the only such event in Poland, during which not only victory counts, but primarily being involved in a sporting and social event.
