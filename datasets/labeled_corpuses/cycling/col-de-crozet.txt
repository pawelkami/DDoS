At the moderately famous Col de la Faucille is the main road back to Geneva. It’s not my favourite – traffic, including lots of trucks on weekdays – as it is a main short cut from Geneva to Dijon. Mathias climbs it fairly frequently, so I decided to show him a better, nearby, deserted-but-paved alternative via Col de Combe Blanche.
See the map to find this road. Basically cycle the main road from Faucille away from Geneva and head to La Vattay. This is one of my favourite cross-country ski stations. At La Vattay, turn in on the only paved road, and just follow. This heads all the way down the Jura mountains – and don’t expect to see more than a car or two. It’s a fantastic alternative.
